         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I was at Mr <persName ref="prsn:Heyw01">Heywood's</persName> this evening, when your welcome letter arrived. I have, indeed, been anxiously waiting for it since Tuesday morning, as my meaning in writing again was in case I made an engagement likely to affect your arrangement. I will be in <placeName ref="tgn:7010692">Sheffield</placeName> on Sunday, if a coach travels, and on my arrival will send J.P.C. [TPC?] to apprise you. I have used the <placeName ref="plc:Oldh01">Oldham Theatre</placeName> four nights of this week with pecuniary success. My subject, the application of science as the revelation of mystery, is very palatable to the people and very annoying to the preachers: [[2]] They are compelled now to say they agree with me as far as  I go ; but I say nothing about a future life. That is now my fault. I retort upon them that I have no evidence in or out of the Bible on the subject ; that I should be an impostor to preach without evidence ; but that I do more than they, I make my people sure of that salvation by setting their lives right here. To this they are bound to assent; but they will have the doctrine of a future life. You will find that my new ground is the right one for progress. God or no God is nonsense. Matter or Spirit is nonsense. But activation of the human mind universally as the catholicity of christianity is every thing. Every kind will follow and cannot lead [[3]] that point, in the way of reform.</p>
         <p>We have the old <placeName ref="tgn:7010692">Sheffield</placeName> Cheques with us and some metal ones. We have enough, I think, as cheques ; but no ticket fit for sale.</p>
         <p>Had I not some books to sell and deliver to morrow, I would have been off by first coach ; but I must stop out tomorrow in <placeName ref="tgn:7010477">Manchester</placeName>. If there be a night coach I may come.</p> 
            <p>Much obliged to you for your attention and hope to give you satisfaction by my conversion to Christianity - Respects to all friends - and yours &amp;C</p>
            <p>R. Carlile</p>
