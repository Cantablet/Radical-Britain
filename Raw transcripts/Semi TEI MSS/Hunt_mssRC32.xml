         <p>Isis to her well-beloved RC, happiness,
            
            I was surprised by a visit from two ladies, last night, after nine o'clock, and who do you think they were ? Mrs. Robinson, and Mrs. Brooks, they wondered what had become of me, and felt anxious to know; Mr. Owen has likewise been very punctual in his enquiries, and wishes much to see me, Mrs. Robinson mentioned Friday for my first visit; and I inadvertently agree[d] to go, when I shall have the pleasure of being introduced to other Mrs and Owenites. 
            Let me be wherever I may, my heart is always with you. I never am so happy, as when with you, and, allow me, again, and again, to assure you of my love, friendship, and esteem, my hope is, Richard, that you will survive me, after twenty years['] engagement, that you will receive my last sigh, that my latest breath, will be received on your affectionate bosom ; the firm reliance, that I have on your honour, and character, gives strength to my love, I feel that you are the best man in the world, and I the most favoured woman. I want my lecture for this evening, to study. When may I expect the one for Sunday, You are really worked to death, and I am ashamed of myself. What can I bring you love ? "
