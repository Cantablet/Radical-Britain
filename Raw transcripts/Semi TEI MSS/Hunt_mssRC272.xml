         <p>Dear Sir,
            since receiving your first letter, it has struck me that it w[oul]d be much better – especially at this time of year – that your lecture sh[oul]d be delivered at Askean[?], a small meeting-place barely a mile from here, &amp; 6 miles N. of Doncaster. there is a good room at Mr. Hough's[?] Swan Hotel, &amp; i am confident you will have a much larger audience there than you could possibly have here. moreover, those who wish to go from Campsall, can easily do so if a notice is inserted in one or two of the windows. three or four notices w[oul]d be enough for both places, put on the walls or in shops windows 2 or 3 days before. at the same time, i am not acquainted with any one who w[oul]d like to take the responsibility of the preparations on himself. it is impossible any one sh[oul]d be able to do this so well as the lecturer himself. the price of entrance, if [[2]] any, sh[oul]d not be more than a penny[! Mark that for generosity! R.C.
            I notice your challenges in the "Northern Star, "&amp; sh[oul]d no doubt take an entirely different view from yourself of each question, but it is of course impossible to discuss any of them in the limits of a letter.
            i rem[ai]n, Dr Sir, | yr. obed. Sert.
            Neville Wood
            
            P.S. I sh[oul]d be inclined to say 1/2 p. 7 o'clock in the evening w[oul]d be the best time for the lecture to commence.
            
            [[3, RC's hand] i was to pay for a room at the Inn, stop there three or four days and charge a penny for admission! Noble, Generous Woods of Campsall Hall ; Mr Neville Wood guaranteeing himself only as one penny customer. my expences would have been at least five pounds, swallowing up twelve hundred pence. what would my profits have been?]
            Adieu ye Woods of Campsall Hall.</p>
