         <p>My Dear Friend,</p>
         <p>It is within the last quarter of an hour that I have read the unwelcome and painful news of the death of <persName ref="prsn:Turt02">your son</persName>. I came in from <placeName ref="tgn:7010560">Stockport</placeName> on sunday and found the paper here ; but, on asking, <persName ref="prsn:Carl02">T.P.C.</persName> had seen nothing it it. I had company and had to return to <placeName ref="tgn:7010560">Stockport</placeName>, so I put it by for another day's perusal. It occurred to me this morning, the first here for a week, that you had sent the paper for something in it ; I saw <persName ref="prsn:Otle01">Otley's</persName> poetry and the Anticorporation meeting but never dreamt of a death concerning me. I began to look at the marriages, to see if <persName ref="prsn:Carl05">Mary Ann</persName> had got married, and then my eye glanced on this unhappy death. I really grieve with you for the loss of this boy because I had formed high hopes of him: he was one of the [[2]] best youths I had met in the country and I have often wished that my boys were like him. I suppose the winter was too severe for him. It has, in <placeName ref="tgn:7010477">Manchester</placeName>, tried me much since Christmas, caused me to neglect my room, which too has been intolerably cold, so that I have not had a good audience since Christmas. I am beginning to move again for the present year. iIt is well I have found a purse ; for I find it difficult to get any income from preaching. Three wednesday evenings, I have been sparring with <persName ref="prsn:Bear01">Beard</persName> about Trinity and Unity; but he is very shy of me. I am in hope to bring out some of them for discussion: at least, this is what I aim at. <persName ref="prsn:Shar01">Mrs. C.</persName> is at <placeName ref="plc:Enfi01">Enfield</placeName> but will join me soon. I spent three weeks with her at Christmas. I hope to make this a fruitful year. I have felt for some days that it was time I wrote you a letter. I sent you a settling parcel just before I left <placeName ref="tgn:7010477">Manchester</placeName> for <placeName ref="tgn:7011781">London</placeName> which I hope you have safely received.</p>
         <p>[[3]] Express my sympathy and condolence with <persName ref="prsn:Turt03">Mrs Turton</persName>, <persName ref="prsn:Carl05">Mary Ann</persName> and <persName ref="prsn:Carl04">Jane</persName>. I cannot imagine any thing that could have been an equal loss to you. Excepting <persName ref="prsn:Carl03">Alfred</persName>, neither of my boys promises to be anything; while I had pictured yours as one of my future preachers.</p>
         <p>I shall be glad to have a letter from you after a few weeks that you have passed the acuteness of your loss.</p>
         <p>It is of no use to talk to you of the will of Divine Providence. My God the father is the Law of Necessity and the loss of this fine boy is a proof of it. God the Son could not save his physical life though it had endowed him with intellectual life. I had not entertained the idea that his illness would lead to premature death â€” Grieve moderately. I must allow a little for I should and do grieve for him myself.</p>
         <p>Respectfully Richard Carlile</p>
