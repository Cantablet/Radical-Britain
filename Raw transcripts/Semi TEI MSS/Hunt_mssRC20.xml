         <p>My dear Mr Thos Thurton Junr/</p>
         <p>Most things now-a-days have a beginning you will allow of course — and I find that unless I begin a letter to you, now that I have ten minutes spare time the odds are 10 to 1 against my finishing it in time for the parcel this week — so here goes —</p>
         <p>I am now snugly settled in the <placeName ref="plc:Lond01">shop</placeName> you have seen advertised - and I trust in a fair way to work my own salvation in this miserable world — you complain that I have not let you know what I have been about lately — I must say If you had shewn me an example and told me what you are at - I should have seen the force [[2]] of your argument much clearer — however I'll tell you a little of my proceedings lately[.] First I took house - low rent - good situation - capital show - and all that sort of thing thought I had made a hit - but no - it was not to be so I suppose - for I was glad to get out of it after 5 months trial with a loss of £30 — after that I took a trip into <placeName ref="tgn:7008171">Yorkshire</placeName> and <placeName ref="tgn:7008154">Lancashire</placeName> selling and buying pictures this was more profitable than the last spec. but still it would not do for me — after that I did nothing for a few weeks, then I conducted my Brother's business during his absence from town - and now - you know what I am at — — if you are not satisfied with the above full and particular account I shall say[?] you have no bowels[.] [[3]] </p>
         <p>You will perceive where I broke off on Monday - the 2nd and I now recommence — at the last minute — I must write for my life or you will have to wait another week for this scrawl[.]</p>
         <p>I ought to tell you why I did not come to <placeName ref="tgn:7010692">Sheffield</placeName> in my tour — the fact is I did not think it a good place for the business I was on — and I sacrificed the the [sic] pleasure I should have experienced in seeing you &amp; other friends — to that Grand object money-making —</p>
         <p>I shall take an early opportunity of again writing to you in the mean time let me hear from you - and believe me to be - in the greatest haste -</p>
         <p>Yours ever</p>
         <p>A Carlile</p>
      </body>
     <note>The shop being referred to here is likely to be No 2 Water-lane, see e.g. The Fly 11 May 1839, p 76</note>
