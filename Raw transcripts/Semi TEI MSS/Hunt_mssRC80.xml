        <p>Dear Sir</p>
        <p>I am perfectly aware that I ought to have written sooner to let you know how we got on at <placeName ref="tgn:7010462">Huddersfield</placeName>, but illness is my excuse and business Father[']s, I am not quite certain whether it was grief at leaving <placeName ref="tgn:7010692">Sheffield</placeName>, or the sight of Huddersfield,  the most horrible town i ever put my foot in, that caused my illness but i was taken very ill on Saturday night, but thank the Father Son and Holy Ghost i am recovering,</p>
        <p>Father delivered six lectures in Huddersfield, commencing on Thursday, with three on Sunday, to an audience something like Angel's visits "few and far between", in a room, not [[2]] a room but a hen roost, or pig stye [sic] or hardly good enough for either, He left on Monday afternoon and arrived here about eight in the evening, since which time i have only left my bed when nature or God the Father, the physical power forced me,</p>
        <p>Father is gone to <placeName ref="tgn:7010534">Bolton</placeName> to Lecture this evening, and perhaps to-morrow, he is not over well.</p>
        <p>If any thing particular should [happen/arise?] in the course of a few days, a letter will find us at Mr <persName ref="prsn:Heyw01">Heywood</persName>[']s <address ref="plc:Manc01"><addrLine>60 Oldham Street</addrLine></address>,</p>
        <p>The Owenistites are creating a great sensation here, there are Lectures and sermons preached by the parsons every day, on the danger of the "Infidelity preached at Mr Bywater's Rooms"</p>
        <p>I must be quick the senna is nearly ready and i shan't be able to write after that.</p> 
        <p>[[3]] I hear for certain that <persName>Mr. C. Clements</persName> is discharged from the Champion, Give our compliments to all respectable Infidels, and say that [father] is grieved that he could not convert them, to the true Faith,</p>
        <p>Say something very kind for me to all your family, I'm afraid i shall never see them again, as i expect, in the present state of things, to be in Abraham's bosom before next spring.</p>
        <p>I remain</p> <p>rather worse than i was a week ago</p>

        <p>My kindest love to Mrs B.....</p>
